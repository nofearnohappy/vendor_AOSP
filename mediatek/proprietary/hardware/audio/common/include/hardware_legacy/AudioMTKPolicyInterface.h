// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The AudioPolicyInterface and AudioPolicyClientInterface classes define the communication interfaces
// between the platform specific audio policy manager and Android generic audio policy manager.
// The platform specific audio policy manager must implement methods of the AudioPolicyInterface class.
// This implementation makes use of the AudioPolicyClientInterface to control the activity and
// configuration of audio input and output streams.
//
// The platform specific audio policy manager is in charge of the audio routing and volume control
// policies for a given platform.
// The main roles of this module are:
//   - keep track of current system state (removable device connections, phone state, user requests...).
//   System state changes and user actions are notified to audio policy manager with methods of the AudioPolicyInterface.
//   - process getOutput() queries received when AudioTrack objects are created: Those queries
//   return a handler on an output that has been selected, configured and opened by the audio policy manager and that
//   must be used by the AudioTrack when registering to the AudioFlinger with the createTrack() method.
//   When the AudioTrack object is released, a putOutput() query is received and the audio policy manager can decide
//   to close or reconfigure the output depending on other streams using this output and current system state.
//   - similarly process getInput() and putInput() queries received from AudioRecord objects and configure audio inputs.
//   - process volume control requests: the stream volume is converted from an index value (received from UI) to a float value
//   applicable to each output as a function of platform specific settings and current output route (destination device). It
//   also make sure that streams are not muted if not allowed (e.g. camera shutter sound in some countries).
//
// The platform specific audio policy manager is provided as a shared library by platform vendors (as for libaudio.so)
// and is linked with libaudioflinger.so
