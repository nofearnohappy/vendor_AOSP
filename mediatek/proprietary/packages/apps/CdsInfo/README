WHAT IT DOES?
=============
This is a engineer mode APK
The purpose of CDS (Common Data Service) engineer mode program is to provide means to acquire the information of data connection,
including Wi-Fi and Mobile, and dump detailed information about network interfaces, such as waln0, ccmni L2 interfaces. 
The RD should be able to debug IP data services issues easily by using this program. 
Moreover, we provide utility tools to send AT commands or shell commands.
