		<img src="divider_horizontal_holo_dark" alt="THIN GREY LINE">
		<p><font color=\"#757575\" size="14">By default, your phone is enabled for Wi-Fi Calling as soon as you enable the Wi-Fi radio. Wi-Fi Calling can be controlled from the Wi-Fi Calling Settings.</font></p>

Once the registration has successfully completed you will see the Wi-Fi Calling icon in the Status Bar.
